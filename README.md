## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **Backend**: Python with PostgreSQL database
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o for personalized recommendations
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data persistence

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL database
- OpenAI API key

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-carbon-footprint-estimator.git
cd ai-carbon-footprint-estimator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py --server.port 5000
```

5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

## Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for AI recommendations

## Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                 # Main Streamlit application
â”œâ”€â”€ carbon_calculator.py   # Core emission calculation logic
â”œâ”€â”€ ai_advisor.py          # AI-powered recommendation engine
â”œâ”€â”€ database_simple.py     # Database operations
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml         # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ .streamlit/

```

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Users answer questions about their lifestyle
2. **Calculation**: The app converts inputs to COâ‚‚ emissions using scientific factors
3. **Visualization**: Results shown with interactive charts and comparisons
4. **AI Analysis**: OpenAI analyzes results and generates personalized advice
5. **Storage**: Results saved to database for progress tracking

## Emission Factors

The calculator uses research-based emission factors:

- **Flights**: 0.3 tonnes COâ‚‚ (short) / 1.5 tonnes COâ‚‚ (long)
- **Transport**: Varies by type (0g-180g COâ‚‚ per km)
- **Diet**: Based on meat/dairy consumption frequency
- **Shopping**: 25kg COâ‚‚ per Â£100 clothing / 15kg COâ‚‚ per Â£100 general
- **Home Energy**: Based on home size and heating type
